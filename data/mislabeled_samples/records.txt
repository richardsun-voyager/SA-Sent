serving True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not so fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .

food True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
while sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any indian restaurant i have been to in new york city , the food was not what i had hoped for .

teapot True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .

with the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great .

the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes , however be warned that the peter 's favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top , like a salad .
*********************

menu True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
we also ordered two hot dogs thinking they would be pretty good since there is a whole section on the menu devoted to them .
*********************
menu True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .
*********************
meal True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
( food was delivered by a busboy , not waiter ) we got no cheese offered for the pasta , our water and wine glasses remained empty our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on wine .

food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)

*********************
dishes True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
good , because hey , it 's more food , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap .

the photobook menu was a cute touch , certainly helped my group and i pick the fried chicken , pork chop , and noodle dishes that we all ordered .

serving True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not so fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .

*********************
money True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
this place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .
*********************

our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese .

*********************
priced True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
i had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that was n't as good .
*********************
dishes True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
good , because hey , it 's more food , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap .
*********************
noodle dishes True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the photobook menu was a cute touch , certainly helped my group and i pick the fried chicken , pork chop , and noodle dishes that we all ordered .

*********************
food True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
while sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any indian restaurant i have been to in new york city , the food was not what i had hoped for .
*********************
portions True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the portions are huge , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .
*********************
places True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , i 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .

the servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait ( shortly i might add ) .
*********************

*********************
service True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
sometimes i get good food and ok service .
*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt in your mouth experience ) .
*********************
teapot True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .

it 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it ( the sauce was translucent and red ) .
*********************
table True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i went here with a friend on a whim , we went someplace else first and could n't get a table .
*********************

*********************
waiter True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
just bring someone who speaks cantonese because waiter may not understand you .
*********************
menu True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .

quality of food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the service , however , is a peg or two below the quality of food ( horrible bartenders ) , and the clientele , for the most part , are rowdy , loud mouthed commuters ( this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff ) getting loaded for an ac dc concert or a knicks game .

if your favorite chinese food is general tao chicken , then this is not your place .
*********************
owner True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
it appears to be the owner 's first venture and it shows .
*********************
sake martini True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
not too crazy about their sake martini .
*********************
manager True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
after 2 tries by the waiter to take it away ( we had n't even looked at it yet , we had full beers yet to drink ) , the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations .
*********************
food True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
while sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any indian restaurant i have been to in new york city , the food was not what i had hoped for .
*********************
portions True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the portions are huge , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .
*********************
places True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , i 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .
*********************
cost True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine , if you can call $ 70.00 inexpensive , the cost is through the roof for better than average fare .
*********************
toppings True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the plain slice is great and if you get toppings , the whole slice is topped with them , not sparsely sprinkled on like some places .
*********************
sushi True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
found service above average , but that could be because we were 13 of us .
*********************
wine True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
only wine and beer are served , but the house varities are actually quite good .
*********************
meal True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
also , top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu .
*********************
tip True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
after all that , they complained to me about the small tip .
*********************
thai True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
but the thai is definitely not great bland and indistinguished .
*********************
noodles True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
stick to dimsum , not super overpriced noodles .
*********************
dinner True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
based on the reviews for dinner , this is a place i would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for dim sum again .
*********************
pepper powder True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
it 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it ( the sauce was translucent and red ) .
*********************
thai food True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
i am not the most experienced person when it comes to thai food , but my friend who took me there is .
*********************
glasses of champagne True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
( $ 200 for 2 glasses of champagne , not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks ) .
*********************
owner True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
same owner as the guy who owns typhoon , which is just down the street on st. marks and 1st ave .
*********************

*********************
cheese True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese .
*********************
meat True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
they are tasty , but i suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average american digestive system .
*********************
crab cocktail True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime .
*********************

skip dessert .
*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt in your mouth experience ) .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .
*********************
staff True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the whole set up is truly unprofessional and i wish cafe noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .
*********************
owners True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but were n't as dismayed or apologetic as i would have expected .
*********************

i went here with a friend on a whim , we went someplace else first and could n't get a table .

bar True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
it saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy , crowded bar at dinnertime .
*********************
menu True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
for some reason , all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the salmon .
*********************
man True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7 , then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving ( mean while there were boths open all around ) .
*********************
menu True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the food is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it 's on the menu or not .
*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the people with carts of food do n't understand you because they do n't speak english , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at .
*********************
menu items True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting , the additional menu items are only written in chinese .
*********************

the food , served in small tasting portions ( as an option ) is very good with each dish being better than the next .
*********************

*********************
prices True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
but for whatever reason , prices are about twice as high .
*********************
menu True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .
*********************

*********************
appetizers True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .

the wine selection ( by the glass and bottle ) is wonderful and i always recommend that friends make a reservation if they 're going to be in town .

*********************
food True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
while sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any indian restaurant i have been to in new york city , the food was not what i had hoped for .

portions True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the portions are huge , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .

places True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , i 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .
*********************
cost True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine , if you can call $ 70.00 inexpensive , the cost is through the roof for better than average fare .

the plain slice is great and if you get toppings , the whole slice is topped with them , not sparsely sprinkled on like some places .

*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)

*********************
teapot True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .

*********************
decor True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
while sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any indian restaurant i have been to in new york city , the food was not what i had hoped for .

portions True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the portions are huge , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .
*********************
places True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , i 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .

cost True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine , if you can call $ 70.00 inexpensive , the cost is through the roof for better than average fare .

*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .

atmosphere True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
it is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere .
*********************
priced True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)

the wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for chinatown ) alternative .
*********************
service True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
you do n't go to mizu for excellent service , you go for the large amounts of food , the amiable atmosphere , and the hole in the wall feeling of the place .

prices are in line .
*********************
serving True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not so fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .

*********************
money True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
this place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .
*********************
table True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
a gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .

the wine selection ( by the glass and bottle ) is wonderful and i always recommend that friends make a reservation if they 're going to be in town .

*********************
food True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
while sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any indian restaurant i have been to in new york city , the food was not what i had hoped for .
*********************
places True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , i 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .
*********************
cost True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine , if you can call $ 70.00 inexpensive , the cost is through the roof for better than average fare .

sushi True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)

*********************
crab cocktail True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime .
*********************

*********************
service True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
sometimes i get good food and ok service .
*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt in your mouth experience ) .
*********************
teapot True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .
*********************
oil True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
it 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it ( the sauce was translucent and red ) .
*********************
table True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
i went here with a friend on a whim , we went someplace else first and could n't get a table .

so i 've never actually been to m proper , but i 've had it delivered a few times .

the food is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it 's on the menu or not .
*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)

*********************
change mojito True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i also ordered the change mojito , which was out of this world .
*********************
menu True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .
*********************
meal True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
( food was delivered by a busboy , not waiter ) we got no cheese offered for the pasta , our water and wine glasses remained empty our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on wine .

*********************
reservations True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
in reality ( to maximize potential diners ) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .

*********************
teapot True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .

*********************
menu True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .

serving True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not so fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .

tanks True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
where tanks in other chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad looking marine life in their murky waters , the tanks at ping 's are clear as glass with healthy looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover 's brunch .

food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the location and ambience is ok but the food is what makes up for it .

prices True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
prices are in line .
*********************
serving True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not so fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .

corriander True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the music does get a little loud at times , but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife , and as i did , i got a whiff of corriander .

this place is worth going even if only for their beer .
*********************
appetizers True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .

do n't dine at tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the non veg selections .

their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under $ 30 .
*********************
atmosphere True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
*********************
place True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
from the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed .
*********************

brunch True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
i had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .
*********************
money True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
this place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .

yes , there might be a wait if you have no reservations .
*********************

our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese .
*********************
specials True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
when we notified him that he did n't mention the specials , he did n't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless .
*********************
bottle True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the only weird thing was if we got a bottle , the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price x4 , which makes no sense whatsoever .
*********************
dhal True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
i like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .
*********************
dress code True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
good atmosphere , combination of all the hottest music dress code is relatively strict except on fridays .

it is the best deal in town for a monday night dinner at a fine restaurant .
*********************
dishes True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
my suggestion is to eat family style because you 'll want to try the other dishes .
*********************
steak True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty .
*********************
dinner True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks
*********************
priced True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
i had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that was n't as good .
*********************
dishes True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
good , because hey , it 's more food , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap .
*********************
wine selection True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the wine selection ( by the glass and bottle ) is wonderful and i always recommend that friends make a reservation if they 're going to be in town .
*********************
reservations True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
in reality ( to maximize potential diners ) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .

lunch True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
in such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch , this place is great .
*********************

fish True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
i had the cod with paella ( spicy and very filling , i 'm a big eater and could only eat half ) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips ( again , a big serving at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries ) .
*********************
manager True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
after 2 tries by the waiter to take it away ( we had n't even looked at it yet , we had full beers yet to drink ) , the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations .
*********************
portions True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the portions are huge , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .
*********************
places True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , i 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .

the plain slice is great and if you get toppings , the whole slice is topped with them , not sparsely sprinkled on like some places .
*********************
sushi True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)

*********************
wine True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)

*********************
meal True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)

based on the reviews for dinner , this is a place i would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for dim sum again .
*********************
pepper powder True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
it 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it ( the sauce was translucent and red ) .
*********************
space True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
and , atlhough tables opened up next to us and we asked for a slightly larger space , they left us awkardly seated .

as we were leaving , the couple standing by the door said to another waiter , we 're not in a hurry .

*********************
teapot True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .

*********************
serving True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not so fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .
*********************

price True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the only weird thing was if we got a bottle , the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price x4 , which makes no sense whatsoever .

this place is worth going even if only for their beer .
*********************
appetizers True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .
*********************
waiter True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
after 2 tries by the waiter to take it away ( we had n't even looked at it yet , we had full beers yet to drink ) , the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations .
*********************
containers True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)

*********************
menu True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
while the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made tiffin so attractive , the menu has been overhauled .

bar True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
it is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere .
*********************
reservation True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
service is highly refined : our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d ' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress .

the atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
*********************

i had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .
*********************
money True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
this place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .
*********************
table True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
a gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .

the photobook menu was a cute touch , certainly helped my group and i pick the fried chicken , pork chop , and noodle dishes that we all ordered .

in reality ( to maximize potential diners ) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .
*********************
chinese food True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
if your favorite chinese food is general tao chicken , then this is not your place .
*********************
owner True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
it appears to be the owner 's first venture and it shows .
*********************
fish True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)

*********************
manager True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
after 2 tries by the waiter to take it away ( we had n't even looked at it yet , we had full beers yet to drink ) , the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations .
*********************
food True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
while sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any indian restaurant i have been to in new york city , the food was not what i had hoped for .
*********************
portions True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the portions are huge , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .
*********************
places True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , i 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .
*********************
cost True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine , if you can call $ 70.00 inexpensive , the cost is through the roof for better than average fare .

sushi True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)

noodles True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
stick to dimsum , not super overpriced noodles .
*********************
dinner True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
based on the reviews for dinner , this is a place i would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for dim sum again .

*********************
meat True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
they are tasty , but i suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average american digestive system .
*********************
crab cocktail True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime .

sometimes i get good food and ok service .
*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt in your mouth experience ) .
*********************
teapot True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .
*********************
dishes True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .
*********************
owners True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but were n't as dismayed or apologetic as i would have expected .
*********************
wine True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
overall , a solid restaurant and at less than $ 40pp ( including wine ) , a solid deal as well .
*********************
service True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables , but the service could have been better .

the food is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it 's on the menu or not .
*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the people with carts of food do n't understand you because they do n't speak english , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at .
*********************

if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not so fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .

*********************
teapot True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .

if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not so fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .

money True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
this place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .

*********************
food True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
while sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any indian restaurant i have been to in new york city , the food was not what i had hoped for .

the pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , i 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .

*********************
service True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
sometimes i get good food and ok service .
*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt in your mouth experience ) .
*********************
teapot True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .

the ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .
*********************

the food is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it 's on the menu or not .
*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the people with carts of food do n't understand you because they do n't speak english , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at .

*********************
menu True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .

tanks True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)

serving True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not so fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .

*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .

*********************
serving True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not so fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .

appetizers True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .

this place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .

the wine selection ( by the glass and bottle ) is wonderful and i always recommend that friends make a reservation if they 're going to be in town .

*********************
portions True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the portions are huge , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .
*********************
places True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , i 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .

even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine , if you can call $ 70.00 inexpensive , the cost is through the roof for better than average fare .

overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious .

*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt in your mouth experience ) .
*********************
teapot True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .
*********************
owners True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but were n't as dismayed or apologetic as i would have expected .

*********************
serving True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not so fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .

bar True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
it is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere .

service is highly refined : our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d ' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress .

their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under $ 30 .
*********************
atmosphere True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
*********************

brunch True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
i had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .
*********************
money True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
this place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .
*********************
table True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
a gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .

when we notified him that he did n't mention the specials , he did n't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless .
*********************
bottle True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the only weird thing was if we got a bottle , the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price x4 , which makes no sense whatsoever .
*********************
dhal True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
i like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .

the wine selection ( by the glass and bottle ) is wonderful and i always recommend that friends make a reservation if they 're going to be in town .

*********************
manager True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
after 2 tries by the waiter to take it away ( we had n't even looked at it yet , we had full beers yet to drink ) , the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations .
*********************
portions True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are huge , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .
*********************
places True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , i 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .

overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious .

*********************
noodles True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)

*********************
meat True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
they are tasty , but i suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average american digestive system .
*********************
crab cocktail True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime .
*********************

tuna True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)

*********************
service True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
sometimes i get good food and ok service .
*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt in your mouth experience ) .
*********************
teapot True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .
*********************
dishes True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .
*********************
oil True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
it 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it ( the sauce was translucent and red ) .
*********************
service True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables , but the service could have been better .

menu True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the food is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it 's on the menu or not .
*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the people with carts of food do n't understand you because they do n't speak english , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at .
*********************
menu items True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting , the additional menu items are only written in chinese .

*********************
change mojito True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i also ordered the change mojito , which was out of this world .
*********************
menu True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .
*********************

went on a 3 day oyster binge , with fish bringing up the closing , and i am so glad this was the place it o trip ended , because it was so great

certainly not the best sushi in new york , however , it is always fresh , and the place is very clean , sterile .
*********************

tanks True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
where tanks in other chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad looking marine life in their murky waters , the tanks at ping 's are clear as glass with healthy looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover 's brunch .

serving True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not so fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .

appetizers True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .

places True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , i 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .

food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt in your mouth experience ) .
*********************
teapot True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .

if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not so fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .

decor is nice though service can be spotty .
*********************
appetizers True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .
*********************
waiter True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)

*********************
money True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
this place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .

*********************
food True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
while sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any indian restaurant i have been to in new york city , the food was not what i had hoped for .
*********************
portions True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the portions are huge , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .
*********************
places True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , i 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .
*********************
cost True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine , if you can call $ 70.00 inexpensive , the cost is through the roof for better than average fare .

overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)

*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt in your mouth experience ) .
*********************
teapot True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .
*********************
owners True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but were n't as dismayed or apologetic as i would have expected .

*********************
service True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)

*********************
serving True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not so fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .

money True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
this place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .

the pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , i 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .
*********************
cost True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine , if you can call $ 70.00 inexpensive , the cost is through the roof for better than average fare .

overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious .
*********************

*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt in your mouth experience ) .
*********************
teapot True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .

the ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .
*********************

the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .

*********************
serving True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not so fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .

brunch True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
i had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .
*********************
money True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
this place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .
*********************
table True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
a gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .

when we notified him that he did n't mention the specials , he did n't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless .

bottle True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the only weird thing was if we got a bottle , the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price x4 , which makes no sense whatsoever .

*********************
manager True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
after 2 tries by the waiter to take it away ( we had n't even looked at it yet , we had full beers yet to drink ) , the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations .
*********************
decor True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
while sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any indian restaurant i have been to in new york city , the food was not what i had hoped for .
*********************
portions True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are huge , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .
*********************
places True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , i 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .

*********************
meat True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
they are tasty , but i suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average american digestive system .
*********************
crab cocktail True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime .
*********************

sometimes i get good food and ok service .
*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt in your mouth experience ) .
*********************
teapot True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .
*********************
dishes True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .
*********************

*********************
change mojito True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i also ordered the change mojito , which was out of this world .
*********************
menu True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .

their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a ' special ' bagel experience .

table True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive .
*********************

*********************
food True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
while sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any indian restaurant i have been to in new york city , the food was not what i had hoped for .

the pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , i 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .

even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine , if you can call $ 70.00 inexpensive , the cost is through the roof for better than average fare .

overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious .

*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt in your mouth experience ) .
*********************
teapot True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .

the waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but were n't as dismayed or apologetic as i would have expected .

it 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it ( the sauce was translucent and red ) .

wine True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
overall , a solid restaurant and at less than $ 40pp ( including wine ) , a solid deal as well .
*********************
service True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)

*********************
menu True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .

*********************
serving True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not so fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .

waiter True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)

do n't dine at tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the non veg selections .

*********************
brunch True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
i had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .
*********************
money True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
this place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .
*********************
table True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
a gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .

the only weird thing was if we got a bottle , the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price x4 , which makes no sense whatsoever .

dhal True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
i like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .

the wine selection ( by the glass and bottle ) is wonderful and i always recommend that friends make a reservation if they 're going to be in town .

*********************
manager True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)

i ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime .

*********************
service True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
sometimes i get good food and ok service .
*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt in your mouth experience ) .
*********************
teapot True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .
*********************
dishes True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .
*********************
oil True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
it 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it ( the sauce was translucent and red ) .
*********************
wine True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
overall , a solid restaurant and at less than $ 40pp ( including wine ) , a solid deal as well .
*********************
service True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables , but the service could have been better .

*********************
menu True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the food is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it 's on the menu or not .
*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the people with carts of food do n't understand you because they do n't speak english , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at .
*********************
menu items True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting , the additional menu items are only written in chinese .

*********************
change mojito True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i also ordered the change mojito , which was out of this world .
*********************
menu True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .

serving True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not so fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .

money True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
this place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .

*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)

*********************
teapot True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .

money True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
this place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .

the wine selection ( by the glass and bottle ) is wonderful and i always recommend that friends make a reservation if they 're going to be in town .

manager True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)

the pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , i 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .
*********************
cost True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine , if you can call $ 70.00 inexpensive , the cost is through the roof for better than average fare .

overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious .

*********************
service True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
sometimes i get good food and ok service .
*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt in your mouth experience ) .
*********************
teapot True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .

the ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .
*********************

the waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but were n't as dismayed or apologetic as i would have expected .
*********************

it 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it ( the sauce was translucent and red ) .

*********************
menu True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .

*********************
warm pitas True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
creamy appetizers taramasalata , eggplant salad , and greek yogurt ( with cuccumber , dill , and garlic ) taste excellent when on warm pitas .
*********************
tanks True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
where tanks in other chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad looking marine life in their murky waters , the tanks at ping 's are clear as glass with healthy looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover 's brunch .
*********************
plain pizza True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom(third generation fornini ) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle ( again making it soggy ) and nothingon the rest .
*********************
rice True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
while this can hardly be called a restaurant , it is possibly the best deal in manhatten : $ 4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2 3 entrees .
*********************
group dinner True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here : simple contract , deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20 .

*********************
vegtables True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
nha trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i 've ever been to . the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables .

atmosphere True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
it is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere .

served True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the bruscetta is a bit soggy , but the salads were fresh , included a nice mix of greens ( not iceberg ) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen .

ummm ... the beer was cold .
*********************
service True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
you do n't go to mizu for excellent service , you go for the large amounts of food , the amiable atmosphere , and the hole in the wall feeling of the place .
*********************
course True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
monday nights are a bargain at the $ 28 prix fix this includes a three course meal plus * three * glasses of wine paired with each course .

pizza True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .

mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .

after dinner , take your date to the huge dance floor , probably one of the biggest you 'll see in ny .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
if it is n't for the food ( a+++ ) , it must be the service or the ambience .

*********************
prices True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
prices are in line .
*********************
serving True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not so fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .
*********************
corriander True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the music does get a little loud at times , but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife , and as i did , i got a whiff of corriander .

looking around , i saw a room full of new yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .
*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
while we enjoyed the food , we were highly disappointed by the poor service ( waiter was not quite competent and slow service ) and lack of remorse .
*********************
price True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the only weird thing was if we got a bottle , the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price x4 , which makes no sense whatsoever .

first , the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials , which i would have chosen had i known about them .

i like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .

do n't dine at tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the non veg selections .
*********************
wine True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under $ 30 .
*********************
atmosphere True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
*********************
place True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
from the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed .

we figured we never had argentinian pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there , sharing a large pelligrino , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent .
*********************
money True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
this place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .
*********************
table True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
a gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .

priced True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
i had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that was n't as good .
*********************
wine selection True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the wine selection ( by the glass and bottle ) is wonderful and i always recommend that friends make a reservation if they 're going to be in town .

reservations True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
in reality ( to maximize potential diners ) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .

in such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch , this place is great .

manager True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
after 2 tries by the waiter to take it away ( we had n't even looked at it yet , we had full beers yet to drink ) , the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations .
*********************
portions True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the portions are huge , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .
*********************
places True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , i 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .
*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the food , served in small tasting portions ( as an option ) is very good with each dish being better than the next .
*********************
sushi True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)

tip True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
after all that , they complained to me about the small tip .

*********************
establishment True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)

*********************
noodles True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
stick to dimsum , not super overpriced noodles .

other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced , the atmosphere is filled with energy ( and the beautiful people of course ) and the food was surprising good
*********************
dinner True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
based on the reviews for dinner , this is a place i would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for dim sum again .

as we were leaving , the couple standing by the door said to another waiter , we 're not in a hurry .

same owner as the guy who owns typhoon , which is just down the street on st. marks and 1st ave .
*********************

*********************
meat True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)

*********************
crab cocktail True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime .
*********************

tuna True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
they showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt .
*********************
service True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
sometimes i get good food and ok service .
*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt in your mouth experience ) .
*********************
teapot True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
*********************
service True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .
*********************
dishes True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .
*********************
oil True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
it 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it ( the sauce was translucent and red ) .
*********************
service True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables , but the service could have been better .
*********************
delivered True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(2)
so i 've never actually been to m proper , but i 've had it delivered a few times .
*********************
bar True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
it saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy , crowded bar at dinnertime .
*********************
man True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(1)
the man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7 , then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving ( mean while there were boths open all around ) .
*********************
menu True label:tensor(1) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the food is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it 's on the menu or not .
*********************
food True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(2)
the people with carts of food do n't understand you because they do n't speak english , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at .
*********************
menu items True label:tensor(2) Pred Label:tensor(0)
the only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting , the additional menu items are only written in chinese .
*********************

*********************
change mojito True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i also ordered the change mojito , which was out of this world .
*********************
menu True label:tensor(0) Pred Label:tensor(1)
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .
*********************
